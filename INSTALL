Dependencies:
  The following are the dependency versions known to work:

    Developer dependencies:
      bison        >= 2.3
      gnu flex     >= 2.5.35
    * gnu flex and bison are only needed for developers, as the main source
      code comes with bison/flex code generation already run)

    Build dependencies:
      gperf        >= 3.0
      GNU make     >= 3.81
    Run dependencies:
      libevent      >= 1.3 (older versions may work)
      libpcre       >= 7.6
      Tokyo Cabinet >= 1.4.9

    Test suite dependencies:
      CUnit        >= 2.1

    Ubuntu dependency list (for ease):
      apt-get install bison ctags flex gperf libevent-dev libpcre3-dev libtokyocabinet-dev

Building:
  make grok    (or 'gmake grok' if your make is not gnu make)

Installing:
  make install

Platforms:
  This has been tested on Linux and FreeBSD. All tests pass in both Linux and
  FreeBSD. It should work elsewhere.
  
FreeBSD Notes:
  You can install this from ports in sysutils/grok

CentOS Notes:
  CentOS 5.3 has an old version of pcre available, too old, in fact. Building a
  new rpm from a more recent Fedora pcre SRPM has worked well for me.
